### Prepare data

MNIST is a database of handwritten numbers. It includes a training set and a test set; the training set contains 60,000 images and their labels, and the test set contains 10,000 images and their labels. Yann LeCun and others have normalized and centered the images and binary file them for download (http://Yann.LeCun.com/exdb/mnist/) . The scripts covered in this article automatically download the MNIST dataset.

### Train and Test

To train and test the model, run python lenet.py

The accuracy of test set should be 99%.
